# This script is used to add a target property name with the same value in the database schema 
# to a vertex which has an existing property. The existing property is not removed.
#
# Note also - This script just makes changes to the schema that is currently live.
#    If you were to create a new schema in a brandy-new environment, it would look like
#    whatever the oxm (as of July 2016) told it to look like.   So, part of making a 
#    change to the db schema should Always first be to make the change in the oxm so that
#    future environments will have the change.  This script is just to change existing
#    instances of the schema since schemaGenerator (as of July 2015) does not update things - it 
#    just does the initial creation.
#
# To use this script, you need to pass four parameters:
#      propertyName    -- the name of the property that has the value to be used in the targetProperty
#      targetPropertyName  -- the name of the targetProperty
#      targetNodeType -- NA if all propertyName instances in the DB are impacted, otherwise limit the change to this nodeType
#      skipCommit -- true or false.     For testing, skips the commit when set to true.
#
# Ie.    propertyNameChange service-id persona-model-id service-instance true
